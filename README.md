# Breakout

An implementation of the classic Breakout game released in 1976 and created by Steve Wozniak. 

# Features 

* Players have a paddle on the bottom of the screen that they control using the keyboard right and left arrow keys 
* There's a ball on the screen hitting and bouncing off anything it hits.
* The paddle is used to bounce the ball upward so that it may hit and and destory any of the bricks that are at the top of the play area. 
* The ball never leaves the play area unless it goes past the level of the paddle, effectively touching the bottom of the screen. If this happens, player loses. 
* Points are accumulated for every brick the player destroys.
* A level is passed once a player destroys all the bricks on that level, leaving nothing but the ball and the paddle. 

# Technologies

* Javascript for logic
* P5.js library for rendering of shapes and images
